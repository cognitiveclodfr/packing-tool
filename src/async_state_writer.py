    Write-behind queue for state persistence.

    Behaviour:
    - schedule(state_dict): non-blocking, replaces any pending write
    - flush(): blocking, waits until the background thread has finished writing
    - shutdown(): flush then stop daemon thread

    Concurrency model:
    - schedule() and flush() must only be called from the main/UI thread
    - Background daemon thread calls the write_fn
    - Incoming state_dict is deep-copied on schedule() so the caller can freely
      mutate its in-memory state immediately after scheduling

    sync_mode=True skips the background thread and writes synchronously;
    useful for unit tests that assert file content after each call.
