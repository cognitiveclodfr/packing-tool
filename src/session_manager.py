"""
Session Manager - Manages the lifecycle of packing sessions.

This module handles session creation, organization by client, and session
state tracking. It integrates with ProfileManager for centralized storage
on the file server.

Key responsibilities:
- Creating timestamped session directories organized by client
- Managing session lock acquisition and heartbeat mechanism
- Tracking active session state for crash recovery
- Providing paths for session data (barcodes, state files, reports)
- Coordinating with SessionLockManager for multi-PC safety

For small warehouse operations, this module ensures that:
- Multiple PCs can work on different orders simultaneously
- Sessions are properly isolated by client
- Crashes don't corrupt data or prevent session recovery
- Historical session data is preserved for analytics

        Start a new packing session or restore a crashed session.

        This method handles two scenarios:
        1. **New Session**: Creates a new timestamped directory and initializes fresh state
        2. **Restore Session**: Recovers a previously crashed session from its directory

        Session Directory Structure:
            SESSIONS/CLIENT_M/2025-11-03_14-30-45/
                session_info.json       (session metadata for recovery)

                output/                 (completed reports)

        Lock Acquisition Process:
        - Before starting/restoring, check if session is locked by another process
        - If locked by another PC -> raise SessionLockedError (show user who has it)
        - If lock is stale (>2 min without heartbeat) -> raise StaleLockError (offer force-release)
        - If lock is ours (same PC, same process) -> reacquire safely
        - After successful lock, start heartbeat timer (updates every 60 seconds)

        For small warehouse operations:
        - Multiple workers on different PCs can pack different orders simultaneously
        - If a PC crashes, session can be restored without data loss
        - Prevents data corruption from concurrent access

        Start periodic heartbeat updates for crash detection.

        This method starts a Qt timer that updates the session lock's heartbeat
        timestamp every 60 seconds. This heartbeat mechanism is critical for
        multi-PC environments to detect crashed sessions.

        How it works:
        1. Timer fires every 60 seconds
        2. Calls _update_heartbeat() which updates lock file
        3. If application crashes, timer stops -> heartbeat stops updating
        4. After 2 minutes without heartbeat, lock is considered "stale"
        5. Other PCs can then detect the crash and offer to take over the session

        For small warehouses:
        - If PC-1 crashes while packing, PC-2 can detect it within 2 minutes
        - No manual intervention needed to identify crashed sessions
        - Prevents long delays in order fulfillment due to crashed sessions
        - Workers can immediately continue work on another PC

        Note: This requires Qt event loop to be running (PySide6.QtCore.QTimer).
        Import is done inside the method to avoid circular dependencies with main.py

        Implementation details:
        - Uses QTimer for cross-platform compatibility (works on Windows/Linux/macOS)
        - 60000 milliseconds = 60 seconds (consistent with SessionLockManager timeout values)
        - Non-critical failure: if heartbeat fails to start, session still works

        It updates the 'heartbeat' field in the .session.lock file with the current
        timestamp, proving to other PCs that this session is still actively running.

        The heartbeat update process:
        1. Read current lock file contents
        2. Update 'heartbeat' field with current timestamp
        3. Write back to file (with file locking to prevent corruption)

        - Other PCs may incorrectly detect session as stale after 2 minutes
        - User would need to force-release stale lock (but our PC is still using it)

        Why this is usually reliable:
        - File server is typically stable (SMB/CIFS protocol)
        - Updates are small and fast (just a JSON timestamp)
        - Failure is rare in practice (tested in real warehouse environments)
