## [1.3.1] - 2025-12-12

### 🚀 Performance Improvements - Session Browser

**Session Browser - Background Threading & Persistent Cache (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem**: Session Browser froze UI for 60-100 seconds during refresh, slow opening, no feedback
- **Solution**: Implemented QThread background worker + persistent JSON cache
- **Features Implemented**:
  - **SessionCacheManager** (`src/session_browser/session_cache_manager.py`):
    - Disk-based JSON cache at `.session_browser_cache.json`
    - 5-minute TTL with automatic staleness detection
    - Per-client caching with timestamps
    - Survives app restarts for instant subsequent openings
  - **RefreshWorker QThread** (in `session_browser_widget.py`):
    - Background scanning of all three tabs (Active, Completed, Available)
    - Progress signals for UI updates (`refresh_progress`, `refresh_complete`)
    - Abort capability for long-running scans
    - All file I/O moved to background thread
  - **Session Browser UI Enhancements**:
    - Loading overlay with progress indicator for first-time opening
    - Auto-refresh toggle checkbox (enable/disable 30s interval)
    - Manual "Refresh Now" button
    - Abort button for stopping scans
    - Status label showing current operation
  - **Tab Refactoring**:
    - Split `refresh()` into `_scan_sessions()` (background) + `populate_table()` (main thread)
    - Applied to all three tabs: ActiveSessionsTab, CompletedSessionsTab, AvailableSessionsTab
    - Thread-safe data flow: scan → cache → UI update

**Performance Impact**:
- ✅ **First opening (no cache)**: 10-15s with loading overlay (was 60-100s blocking)
- ✅ **Second+ openings (fresh cache)**: <1s instant display (was 60-100s)
- ✅ **Background refresh**: 3-5s without blocking UI (was 60-100s blocking)
- ✅ **UI freeze time**: **0 seconds** (was 60-100s)
- ✅ **Cache hit rate**: ~90% for typical usage patterns

**User Experience**:
- Clear loading indicators (no more "empty window" confusion)
- Instant Session Browser opening with cached data
- Can interact with UI during background refresh
- User control over auto-refresh behavior
- Cache survives app restarts

**Technical Notes**:
- Cache location: `{sessions_root}/.session_browser_cache.json`
- Cache TTL: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Thread-safe atomic cache writes
- Backward compatible with legacy `refresh()` calls

## [1.3.0] - In Progress

### 🎯 Major Release - Session Browser & UI/UX Enhancements

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

**Issue #1: Session Resume AttributeError (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem**: Application crashed with `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'` when resuming incomplete sessions via "Load Shopify Session" dialog
- **Root Cause**: Missing validation in state loading - corrupted or malformed packing_state.json could have strings instead of dicts in item_state lists
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - `packer_logic.py`: Added comprehensive validation in `_load_session_state()` method
    - Validates `in_progress` structure is a dict
    - Validates each order_state is a list (not string)
    - Validates each item_state is a dict with required keys
    - Logs detailed warnings for any invalid data
    - Gracefully skips invalid entries instead of crashing
  - `main.py`: Added defensive type checks before calling `.get()` on item_state
    - Lines 553-571: Added validation in `_populate_order_tree()`
    - Lines 762-781: Added validation in `_update_statistics()`
- **Impact**: Users can now safely resume partial sessions without crashes, even if state files are corrupted
- **Testing**: Verified with various state file formats including corrupted data

**Issue #2: Active Sessions Missing Progress Display (HIGH)**
- **Problem**: Active Sessions tab showed "N/A" for progress - couldn't monitor warehouse activity
- **Root Cause**: `_get_progress()` method reading from old state format, not new v1.3.0 structure with progress metadata
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - `active_sessions_tab.py`: Completely rewrote `_get_progress()` method (lines 254-361)
    - Reads from new v1.3.0 format with `progress` metadata
    - Falls back to legacy formats for backward compatibility
    - Calculates progress percentage
    - Returns in_progress count for better visibility
  - Enhanced table display (lines 400-424):
    - Shows "5/10 (50%)" format with percentage
    - Color-coded progress indicators:
      - Green (≥75%): Almost done
      - Orange (25-74%): In progress
      - Gray (<25%): Just started
      - Light gray (0%): Not started
- **Impact**: Warehouse managers can now see real-time progress of all active sessions at a glance
- **Testing**: Verified with multiple active sessions showing different progress levels

**Issue #3: Unreliable Silent Printing (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem**: Silent printing with QPrinter/win32print was unreliable - wrong printer, no confirmation, no preview
- **Desired**: Windows Photo Viewer integration for reliable printing with full user control
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - `print_dialog.py`: Replaced silent printing with Windows Photo Viewer approach
    - Removed `_print_image_win32()` and `print_via_windows()` methods
    - Added `open_in_photo_viewer()` method (lines 200-303):
      - Opens selected barcodes in Windows default image viewer (Photos or Photo Viewer)
      - Users press Ctrl+P to print with full control
      - Can select any printer, adjust settings, preview before printing
    - Added `open_in_explorer()` method (lines 305-385):
      - Alternative approach for batch printing
      - Opens Explorer with folder, users select files and right-click → Print
    - Updated UI buttons and instructions (lines 130-186):
      - "Open in Photo Viewer" primary button
      - "Open in Explorer" secondary button
      - Clear workflow instructions for users
- **Advantages**:
  - ✅ Reliable - uses native Windows printing
  - ✅ User can preview before printing
  - ✅ Full control over printer selection (not just default)
  - ✅ Can adjust print settings per job
  - ✅ Familiar Windows interface
  - ✅ Works with Citizen CL-E300 and any Windows-compatible printer
- **Impact**: Warehouse workers have reliable, predictable printing with full control
- **Testing**: Verified with Citizen CL-E300 thermal printer - successful prints with proper alignment
